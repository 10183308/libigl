# Outlook for continuing development [future]

Libigl is in active development, and we plan to focus on the following features
in the next months:

* A better and more consistent **documentation**, plus extending this tutorial
  to cover more libigl features.

* Implement a **mixed-integer solver** which only uses Eigen to remove the
  dependency on CoMiSo.

* Improve the robustness and performance of the active set QP solver. In
  particular, handle linearly dependent constraints.

* Implement more mesh analysis functions, including structural analysis for
  masonry and _3D-printability_ analysis.

* Increase support for point clouds and general polygonal meshes.

* What would you like to see in libigl? [Contact
  us!](mailto:alecjacobson@gmail.com) or post a [feature
  request](https://github.com/libigl/libigl/issues/new).

We encourage you to contribute to the library and to report problems and bugs.
The best way to contribute new feature or bug fixes is to fork the libigl
repository and to open a [pull
request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) on [our github
repository](https://github.com/libigl/libigl).
